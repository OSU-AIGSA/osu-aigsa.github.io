# Generative AI

AIGSA officer Aseem is running the reading group on Generative AI. Generative AI has excited both the AI community and the public. The goal of this reading group is to understand technically and intuitively how these generative models work. We will discuss GANs, VAEs, transformers, and more. We hope that this material will be useful for your research!

This group will meet **every Friday at 4pm in KEC 4107, with free Chipotle dinner afterwards.**

For the first half hour of each meeting, we’ll discuss material from [Stanford’s course on Deep Generative Models](https://deepgenerativemodels.github.io/). For the second half, a reading group member will present a relevant paper.
