# Spring 2023 Reading Groups

Take your pick of two reading groups this term! 

Join the conversation in the reading group channels on [Discord](https://discord.gg/wGrtzFM8sJ).

## [The Flavors of Reinforcement Learning](https://www.aigsa.club/rlflavors/)

AIGSA member Aayam is our guide to The Flavors of Reinforcement Learning. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful and versatile machine learning paradigm that has revolutionized our ability to tackle complex decision-making problems. In this reading group, we will delve into the various flavors of reinforcement learning, providing a high-level overview of different RL techniques and their applications.

This group will meet **every Thursday at 4pm** with food provided. 

To prepare for each meeting, please spend **~1 hour** on the week's learning materials, Details [here](https://www.aigsa.club/rlflavors/).

## [Generative AI](https://www.aigsa.club/genai/)

AIGSA officer Aseem is running the reading group on Generative AI. Generative AI has excited both the AI community and the public. The goal of this reading group is to understand technically and intuitively how these generative models work. We will discuss GANs, VAEs, transformers, and more. We hope that this material will be useful for your research!

This group will meet **every Friday at 4pm in KEC 4107**, with free Chipotle dinner afterwards.

For the first half hour of each meeting, we'll discuss material from [Stanford's course on Deep Generative Models](https://deepgenerativemodels.github.io/). For the second half, a reading group member will present a relevant paper.

# Application Support (AIASP)
For the Fall 2022 application cycle, we launched the Artificial Intelligence Application Support Program (AIASP), a service run by volunteer graduate students in our school to assist folks historically underrepresented in the field as they apply to AI graduate programs (M.S./Ph.D.) at OSU! You can find more info [here](https://www.aigsa.club/aiasp).
