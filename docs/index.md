# Fall 2023 Reading Groups

Take your pick of two reading groups this term! 

Each group will meet **weekly** with **food provided**. To prepare for each meeting, please spend ~1 hour on the week's learning materials. **Details will be shared on [Discord](https://discord.gg/wGrtzFM8sJ)**.

## AI Governance
As governments around the world pass historic AI policies, this is a great time to learn about AI policy and form our own opinions about how to mitigate risks from AI. AIGSA co-president Kendrea will base the material on the [AI Safety Fundamentals Governance curriculum](https://course.aisafetyfundamentals.com/governance).

## The Flavors of Reinforcement Learning

AIGSA officer Aayam is our guide to The Flavors of Reinforcement Learning. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful and versatile machine learning paradigm that has revolutionized our ability to tackle complex decision-making problems. In this reading group, we will delve into the various flavors of reinforcement learning, providing a high-level overview of different RL techniques and their applications.

# Application Support (AIASP) - Open for Fall 2023
In the Fall 2022 application cycle, we launched the Artificial Intelligence Application Support Program (AIASP), a service run by volunteer graduate students in our school to assist folks historically underrepresented in the field as they apply to AI graduate programs (M.S./Ph.D.) at OSU! You can find more info [here](https://www.aigsa.club/aiasp).
