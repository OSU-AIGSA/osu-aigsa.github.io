# About AIGSA
The goal of the Oregon State University **A**rtificial **I**ntelligence **G**raduate **S**tudent **A**ssociation (AIGSA) is to connect current, former, and affiliated AI graduate students of the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and any other graduate students working in the space of Artificial Intelligence. Contact us at [ai.gsa@oregonstate.edu](mailto:ai.gsa@oregonstate.edu).

# Winter 2023 Reading Group
This term's reading group topic is **Foundations of Learning Theory**. "Can my algorithm converge on the truth?" is an important question to ask when starting an AI problem, and a lot of theory has gone into proving an answer. We will explore one of these theoretical frameworks--Formal Learning Theory, which explores what can be learned from empirical data--as we work toward understanding the famous "No Free Lunch" theorems.

We will meet five times total this term, **1-2pm on alternating Thursdays** (Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10). 

To prepare for each meeting, please spend **~1 hour** on the week's reading. 

To serve as a counterexample to the "No Free Lunch" theorems, **free lunch** from Chipotle and/or Cafe Yumm will be provided.

# Application Support (AIASP)
For the Fall 2022 application cycle, we launched the Artificial Intelligence Application Support Program (AIASP), a service run by volunteer graduate students in our school to assist folks historically underrepresented in the field as they apply to AI graduate programs (M.S./Ph.D.) at OSU! You can find more info [here](https://www.aigsa.club/aiasp).
