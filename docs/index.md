# Spring 2023 Reading Groups

Take your pick of two reading groups this term! Make sure to join the conversation on [Discord](https://discord.gg/wGrtzFM8sJ).

## The Flavors of Reinforcement Learning

AIGSA member Aayam is our guide to The Flavors of Reinforcement Learning. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful and versatile machine learning paradigm that has revolutionized our ability to tackle complex decision-making problems. In this reading group, we will delve into the various flavors of reinforcement learning, providing a high-level overview of different RL techniques and their applications.

This group will meet **every Thursday at 4pm** with lunch provided.

To prepare for each meeting, please spend **~1 hour** on the week's learning materials. 

## Generative AI

AIGSA officer Aseem is running the reading group on Generative AI.

This group will meet **every Friday at 4pm** (location TBD).

For the first half hour of each meeting, we'll discuss material from [Stanford's course on Deep Generative Models](https://deepgenerativemodels.github.io/). For the second half, a reading group member will present a relevant paper. 

# Application Support (AIASP)
For the Fall 2022 application cycle, we launched the Artificial Intelligence Application Support Program (AIASP), a service run by volunteer graduate students in our school to assist folks historically underrepresented in the field as they apply to AI graduate programs (M.S./Ph.D.) at OSU! You can find more info [here](https://www.aigsa.club/aiasp).
