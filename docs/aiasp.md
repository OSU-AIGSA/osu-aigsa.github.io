# AI Application Support Program

**AIASP has reached capacity for this years admissions cycle. Please check back next year to participate!**

## For Applicants
We're excited to announce the Artificial Intelligence Application Support Program (AIASP) for folks historically underrepresented in the field applying to AI graduate degree programs at Oregon State University!

AIASP is divided into two phases, both of which are primarily supported by current graduate student volunteers in the AI program at OSU:

**Phase 1** - Graduate School Chats. In the first phase, applicants will have a thirty-minute one-on-one chat with one of our mentors. These chats will provide perspective to applicants wondering if graduate school is right for them, and demystify the application process.

**Phase 2** - Application Feedback. In the second phase, applicants will receive early feedback on their Statement of Purpose and CV. They may share any information about their identity and research interests that they'd like considered when matching their application materials with a mentor for review.

You can register to participate with [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfkcxxBeV57L0EET9QdU07j-DeIuR_hMDtQiWc-gR8QEOXIIw/viewform?usp=sf_link)! We're looking forward to all the new connections we'll get to make along the way in this exciting first year of AIASP ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

Participation in AIASP is completely separate from the official graduate application process and therefore does not guarantee admission to the program. Information will be aggregated and anonymized to evaluate the impact of this program, but individual responses will be deleted at the end of this application cycle. Mentors will not review the applicant's official application, and the applicant's participation in AIASP will not be disclosed to the admissions committee or any faculty members.

## For Mentors
This is the first time AIGSA is running a mentorship program, so we urge you to sign up to mentor an applicant in navigating the application process!

You can choose to either participate in Phase 1 and/or Phase 2 (details above) depending on the time you are willing to commit. About 2-3 hours per student if participating in both phases.

In Phase 1, you will have a 30-minute chat with an applicant about the following topics:
- What is grad school like?
- What is it like being a grad student at OSU?
- What experiences or topics should the applicant highlight in their Statement of Purpose?
- Where should the applicant's letters of recommendation come from?

In Phase 2, you will provide feedback on the applicantâ€™s Statement of Purpose and CV.

To sign up, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdRrDeYJ2dsrxyL2lUTyFy7DcN4E85tt2GorK9CkGUv3QBWPQ/viewform?usp=sf_link). 

We highly appreciate suggestions regarding the mentorship program. Please feel free to contact the lead AIASP coordinator Eric Slyman (slymane[at]oregonstate[dot]edu) with your comments or queries regarding the program.
