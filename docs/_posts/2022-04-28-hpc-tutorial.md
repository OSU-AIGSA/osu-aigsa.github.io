Robert Yelle is joining AIGSA to give a **tutorial on using the CoE HPC cluster** next **Thursday, 4/28**, from **4:00 PM - 5:00 PM over Zoom**. 

In this tutorial, students will be introduced to HPC systems in general and to details of the CoE HPC cluster. Students will be introduced to the process of submitting interactive or batch jobs via slurm on the CoE HPC cluster, and how to customize resource requests. Additionally, students will be shown how to manage submitted jobs, how to check the status of their jobs via logs and slurm commands, receive email alerts on failures, and other ways and tools to assist them in becoming more proficient on using the CoE HPC cluster. 

The event will be live-streamed over Zoom. Please see the member email or contact us for details. We hope to see you there!
