Since it's that time of year to apply for Summer internships, AIGSA will be hosting a virtual resume review session on **Thursday, January 20th from 6:00 PM - 7:00 PM on the AIGSA Discord.** This event will be an opportunity for participants to get feedback on their own resumes while also providing feedback for others. To participate, just show up to the AIGSA Discord server during the event and we will organize into individual breakout rooms of around 3-4 people. Each participant will then share their resume with other group members and then discuss it.

Please RSVP [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd0iMDMWNw5C6yUOGnUsdSKS3ZApLBP8a7RGqjhzkKMavCroQ/viewform?usp=sf_link). Accommodation requests may be submitted through the RSVP link, or to [ai.gsa@oregonstate.edu](mailto:ai.gsa@oregonstate.edu), by **Tuesday, January 18th.**

If you plan on participating but are not part of the AIGSA Discord server, you can join [here](https://discord.gg/wGrtzFM8sJ). Note that the Discord server is limited to AIGSA members, so make sure to also join the club [here](https://apps.ideal-logic.com/osusee?key=F3T9-25VWY_5878-CZ4R_f7b06f23)) if you haven't already.

If you don't yet have a resume, then the materials under "Professional Materials" [here](https://career.oregonstate.edu/careered/graduate-students) may be a helpful place to start.

Though we believe that it will be most beneficial to work in groups, we also understand if any participants have reservations about sharing their resumes. For this reason, we will also offer 10-minute one-on-ones which should be reserved in advance by adding your name to the schedule [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BRrplhGMeShJLKslL2ugPMne4QsqoSVqu4kzwd3fk7c/edit?usp=sharing). These slots will be filled on a first-come-first-serve basis, so make sure to sign up early if you need one.

We hope to see you there!
