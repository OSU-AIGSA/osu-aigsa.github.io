We’re excited to invite you to an evening of bowling, snacks, and community with the AI Graduate Student Association! Along with some well-deserved fun and networking, we’ll also take time to discuss the ongoing strike and its implications for Graduate Assistants (GAs) in our programs. This open discussion is an opportunity to understand why the strike is happening, what it means for each of us, and how we might approach our individual responses.

This event is open to all current and incoming students interested in AI. Whether you’re new to the program or already a familiar face, it’s a great chance to unwind, share insights, and have fun. Please RSVP to confirm your spot by using the link below.
