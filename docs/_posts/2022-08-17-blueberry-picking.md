AIGSA goes blueberry picking!Â 

Let's meet at **Radke's Blueberries** on **Wednesday, August 17 at 9:30am** to beat the heat. 

U-pick blueberries cost $2 per pound, which is pretty great considering that a pint of berries easily costs $5 at the Farmers' Market! You can also buy already-picked blueberries for $3 per pound.

The farm is at 490 SE Three Mile Ave. That's a 13-minute drive or a 30-minute bike ride from Kelley. We're coordinating rides on the [AIGSA Discord](https://discord.gg/wGrtzFM8sJ).
