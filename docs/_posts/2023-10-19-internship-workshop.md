The AIGSA is organizing a workshop for AI grad students to receive and give advice about internships on **Thursday, Oct 19th, between 4-5pm in Weniger Hall Room 149 with free food courtesy of the AIGSA**. Attendees will pair up and discuss their experiences applying for internships, the interview process, and making the best of the internship experience. We hope this will be a great opportunity to learn from and network with your peers.

**We will also be joined by Chris Nelson from the Graduate Writing Center and he will be answering any questions you might have about resume and cover letter best practices.** He will also be telling you about the counseling resources that are available to everyone through the Graduate Writing Center. **Please submit any questions you might have for Chris through the RSVP form available [here](https://forms.gle/iPDAtn8yeEjx74uc8).**
