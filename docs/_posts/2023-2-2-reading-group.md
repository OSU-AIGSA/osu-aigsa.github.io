The [Winter 2023 AIGSA reading group](https://www.aigsa.club) is about Foundations of Learning Theory. Join us for this meeting, **even if you didn't attend previous meetings**! Lunch will be provided.

This week, we'll talk about what it takes to design an algorithm to "Converge to the Truth and Nothing But the Truth". This will introduce us to the "New Riddle of Induction" and some very foundational questions about verifying a hypothesis.

To prepare, **please spend up to 1 hour reading** Section 1 ["Convergence to the Truth and Nothing But the Truth"](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/learning-formal/#ConvTrutNothButTrut) of the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry about Formal Learning Theory.
