We are excited to announce a virtual **talk+Q&A session from OSUâ€™s own distinguished alumnus Dr. David Piorkowski! Dr. Piorkowski will share the wisdom he has gained on his path from graduate school to his career in an industry research lab.** After the talk, there will be an informal Q&A session.

David Piorkowski (pronounced like pure-cough-ski) graduated with his Computer Science PhD in HCI at Oregon State University in 2016 advised by Dr. Margaret Burnett. He has worked for the last 7 years at IBM Research in NY where he currently works on HCI problems in the domain of AI Safety. Today, with the benefit of hindsight, David will share some of his perspectives on what went right and what went wrong during his graduate school days at OSU and share his perspectives on what it is like to work in an industry research lab. Afterwards, we'll have an open Q&A session where attendees can ask any questions they may have for David about his time at OSU, IBM, job searching or anything else.
