Join us for the HPC Tutorial event, a two-part tutorial to be held on **Wednesday, May 24 from 3-4 pm** and **Thursday, May 25 from 4-5 pm**, conducted by Robert Yelle who is the High Performance Computing Manager at OSU.

First part of the tutorial would cover general topics of HPC clusters and the second part would cover some special topics related to rendering on HPC clusters.

If you would like, please fill out this _very short_ [**1-2 minute survey**](https://tinyurl.com/aigsa-hpc-spring23) asking you what topics and specific things you would like Rob to cover.
