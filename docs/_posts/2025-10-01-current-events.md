AIGSA is hosting a bi-weekly current events in AI & dinner in KEC 1114 from 5-6pm starting October 1st. This is an informal event, designed to be whatever the group wants it to be. We could talk about AI events, network, just hangout and meet eachother, or more formally teach eachother about what we do. The format is completely up to those that attend! AND you get free dinner ... what's there to lose? :)
