AIGSA member Aayam is our guide to The Flavors of Reinforcement Learning. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful and versatile machine learning paradigm that has revolutionized our ability to tackle complex decision-making problems. In this reading group, we will delve into the various flavors of reinforcement learning, providing a high-level overview of different RL techniques and their applications.

This group will meet **every Thursday at 4pm** with food provided.

To prepare for each meeting, please spend **~1 hour** on the week's learning materials, listed on the event page for each discussion below.
