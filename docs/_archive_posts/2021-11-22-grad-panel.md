AIGSA will be hosting a **Graduate Student Panel** on **Monday, November 22nd**, from **5:00 PM to 6:30 PM** in **KEC 1005**. This panel will be an opportunity to get advice from senior and recently graduated graduate students on how to succeed in your graduate career. In addition, there is reserved social time after the panel where everyone can have the opportunity to chat with the panelist in a less formal setting.

Here's a short bio from each of our panelists:
- **Anurag Koul (he/him), 6th-Year Ph.D.:** Anurag Koul is a Ph.D. student at Oregon State University under the supervision of Prof. Alan Fern with a research background in reinforcement learning involving explainability in Artificial intelligence, model-based reinforcement learning, and offline-reinforcement learning.
- **Abrar Fallatah (she/her), 5th-Year Ph.D.:** Abrar Fallatah is a Ph.D. student advised by Heather Knight and Margaret Burnett in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department at Oregon State University. Abrar's research interests are at the intersections of user interfaces, human-computer, and human-robot interactions. Abrar is currently exploring the applicability of inclusive design methods -- mainly gender-cognitive inclusivity -- on the design process for social robots. She also conducted usability and ethnographic studies with minimal non-anthropomorphic robots (i.e., furniture robots), focusing on generating robotics behaviors that convey personality and express intentions via motion and approach pathways.
- **Claire Lee (she/they), 2nd-Year MS:** Hailing from South Korea, Claire is a big fan of spicy noodles and furry animals. Previously, she studied Applied Mathematics at Columbia University and worked as a Data Analyst in various fields, namely finance, digital marketing, and pharmaceutical.
- **Juneki Hong (he/him), 6th-Year Ph.D.:** Originally studying Computational Linguistics, Juneki Hong now applies ML/DL from NLP domains to Biological ones. Juneki Hong is a Ph.D. student jointly advised by David Hendrix and Liang Huang.
- **Chanho Kim, Postdoc:** Chanho Kim is a postdoc researcher in Professor Fuxin Li's group. He received his Ph.D. from Georgia Tech in 2020 under the supervision of Professor James Rehg. His main research interests are object tracking, object detection, and deep sequence models for video recognition problems.
