The [Winter 2023 AIGSA reading group](https://www.aigsa.club) is about Foundations of Learning Theory. Join us for this meeting, **even if you didn't attend previous meetings**! 

This week, in the culmination of the reading group, we discuss the No Free Lunch Theorems. The theorems make statements about the computational complexity of finding solutions for mathematical problems, but nothing about Chipotle!
Listen to this 50-minute talk to prepare for the discussion: [David Wolpert on The No Free Lunch Theorems and Why They Undermine The Scientific Method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7EUBbZtRxU)
