The [Winter 2023 AIGSA reading group](https://www.aigsa.club) is about Foundations of Learning Theory. Join us for this meeting, **even if you didn't attend previous meetings**! Lunch will be provided.

This week's topic is **Formalizing Learning Theory**. We've introduced two Riddles of Induction, but how are we supposed to prove anything without some formal definitions!? Join us as we delve into how learning theory becomes formalized.

To prepare, **please spend ~1/2 hour reading** the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy [supplement "Basic Formal Definitions"](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/learning-formal/supplement.html).
