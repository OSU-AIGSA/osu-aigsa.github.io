The [Winter 2023 AIGSA reading group](https://www.aigsa.club) is about Foundations of Learning Theory. Join us for this meeting, **even if you didn't attend previous meetings**! We're moving the meeting time from Thursday to Wednesday so that more people can attend. Lunch will be provided.

This week, Formal Learning Theory meets Alan Turing! What does computational complexity have to do with hypothesis testing? **Find out by spending about an hour with this paper:** [The Hierarchies of Knowledge and the Mathematics of Discovery](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/philosophy/docs/glymour/hierarchiesofk.pdf).
