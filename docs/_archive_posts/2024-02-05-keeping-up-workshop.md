Join us for a workshop on keeping up with your research field! This event was inspired by our own questions about how to stay up to date even when not actively working on a lit review.

We'll reflect on questions like: 
- What value are we looking for from the research literature & community, and how can we maximize value gained while minimizing time spent?
- What are our favorite academic journals for our subfields or AI in general?
- What are some strategies for reading research papers?

We're putting on the workshop in collaboration with the OSU Engineering Librarian, and we'll also share advice on the topic that we've gathered from OSU AI professors.

We'll provide coffee, tea, and muffins!
